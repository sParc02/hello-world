# hello-world

I'm in the process of learning Python and checking out GitHub. Always looking for good resources (books, videos, apps) and mentors. My primary field of work and study is structural engineering. I'm interested in automating workflows within my company and taking a deeper dive into the Autodesk API, focusing on Advance Steel, Navisworks, Revit and Dynamo.
